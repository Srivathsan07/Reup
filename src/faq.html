                    <p class="font-16">Cannabinoids are compounds produced by the Cannabis plant that actually produce the effects people talk about. Everyone already knows the most famous cannabinoids -- THC and CBD -- but there are actually over 100 different cannabinoids. How much of one or more cannabinoids that are in a product will help determine how it makes you feel. </p>

                    <p class="font-16">Terpenes on the other hand are compounds produced by the plant that affect how it smells and tastes. The fact that Lemon Diesel tastes so citrusy -- that's because of a terpene called limonene. Like cannabinoids there are 100s of different terpenes in the plant that will make it into your products, and there's some evidence that they work together with cannabinoids to affect the high you feel. We'll keep you in the loop as we learn about cannabinoids, terpenes, and how they affect you through the products in your box.</p>
